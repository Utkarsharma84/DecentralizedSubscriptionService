# Decentralized Subscription Service

## Project Title
**Decentralized Subscription Service**

## Project Description
This project enables creators to offer subscription-based services on a decentralized platform. The platform utilizes smart contracts to manage payments, grant access to content, and track the subscription status of users. Subscribers can register for content access, and the smart contract automates payment management based on the subscription lifecycle.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to empower content creators with a decentralized solution for offering subscription services, eliminating intermediaries and allowing secure, transparent transactions between creators and subscribers. This platform enables creators to maintain control over their content, while subscribers can enjoy uninterrupted access to services as long as their subscription is active.

## Key Features
- **Subscription Management**: Creators can set up subscriptions, and users can subscribe to services with automatic renewal or expiration management through smart contracts.
- **Decentralized Payments**: Payments are handled directly through the smart contract, ensuring transparency and reducing the need for third-party payment processors.
- **Content Access**: Access to creator content is managed based on subscription status, ensuring that only active subscribers can access exclusive content.
- **Real-time Subscription Status**: Subscribers and creators can check the status of their subscriptions and see when a subscription starts and ends.
